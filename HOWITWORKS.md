Express Auto Router is an elegant solution that transforms your directory structure into a fully functional Express.js routing system. It follows the philosophy of "convention over configuration" similar to Next.js and Nuxt.js, but for Express.js backend applications.

### 1. Directory Structure as Routes
The system uses your file system structure to automatically generate Express routes. For example:
```
routes/
  ├── _middleware.js         # Global middleware
  ├── users/
  │   ├── _middleware.js     # Users-specific middleware
  │   ├── index.js           # /users/ endpoint
  │   └── [id]/              # Dynamic parameter
  │       ├── _middleware.js # User-specific middleware
  │       └── index.js       # /users/:id/ endpoint
```

### 2. Key Design Decisions

#### Dynamic Routes
- Uses a bracket notation `[paramName]` for dynamic route parameters
- Automatically converts these to Express.js style parameters (`:paramName`)
- Example: `/users/[userId]/posts/[postId]/` becomes `/users/:userId/posts/:postId/`

#### Hierarchical Middleware
One of the most powerful features is the hierarchical middleware system:
- Middleware cascades down from parent to child routes
- Each directory can have its own `_middleware.js` file
- Middleware is applied in order from most general to most specific
- Example: A request to `/api/users/123/` will execute middleware in this order:
  1. `/api/_middleware.js`
  2. `/api/users/_middleware.js`
  3. `/api/users/[id]/_middleware.js`

#### Strict Route Endings
An opinionated decision in the code is the use of trailing slashes (`/`). The router is configured with `{ strict: true }`, which means:
- All routes must end with a trailing slash
- `/users` and `/users/` are treated as different routes
- This is enforced throughout the system for consistency

## Opinions in the Code

1. **Strict Mode**
```javascript
const routerOptions = options.routerOptions || { strict: true }
```
The code enforces strict mode by default, treating trailing slashes as significant.

2. **Middleware File Naming**
```javascript
export function isMiddlewareFile(entry) {
  return entry.isFile() && entry.name === '_middleware.js'
}
```
The system expects middleware files to be named exactly `_middleware.js`.

3. **Hierarchical Middleware Organization**
The `dictionaryKeyStartsWithPath` function enforces a hierarchical middleware structure, sorting by path length to ensure proper execution order. Please note this is an opinion of how middleware should work and is baked into this system. If you want to control this it would have to be done inside the middleware.

4. **Parameter calls**

Global parameters/options can be passed to the controllers and middleware like this

```javascript

const middlewareOptions = { logLevel: debug }
const controllerOptions = { env: 'test' }
composeRoutes(express, routeMappings, { middlewareOptions, controllerOptions } )
```

You should write your Controllers like this.

```javascript
module.exports = ( router, controllerOptions ) => {
  ...
  return router
}
```

You should write your Middleware like this.

```javascript
module.exports = ( middlewareOptions ) => {
  return [
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Potential Issues and Considerations

### 1. Trailing Slash Handling
The biggest potential issue is the strict trailing slash requirement:

**Pros:**
- Consistent URL structure
- Clear distinction between directories and files
- Prevents double-slash issues

**Cons:**
- Many load balancers and Nginx configurations may strip trailing slashes
- Can cause issues with some CDNs
- May require additional configuration in reverse proxies

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Configure Nginx to preserve trailing slashes:
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
    proxy_redirect off;
}
```

2. Use URL rewriting rules to add trailing slashes if missing

### 2. Middleware Control
While the hierarchical middleware system is powerful, it can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. The code allows for fine-grained control through:

1. Selective middleware application
2. Middleware can check the route and choose to skip processing
3. Order of middleware is predictable based on path depth

## Best Practices When Using This System

1. **Consistent Route Structure**
   - Always use trailing slashes in your routes
   - Keep route parameters in brackets: `[paramName]`
   - Use descriptive parameter names

2. **Middleware Organization**
   - Place shared middleware at the highest appropriate level
   - Use middleware selectively - don't add unnecessary layers
   - Consider performance implications of deeply nested routes

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling middleware at the appropriate levels
   - Use the hierarchical structure to catch errors at the right scope

4. **Testing**
   - Test routes with and without trailing slashes
   - Verify middleware execution order
   - Test dynamic parameter handling

## Future Considerations

1. **Optional Strict Mode**
   - Consider making the strict trailing slash behavior configurable
   - Add options for automatic slash handling

2. **Middleware Enhancement**
   - Add support for middleware priority ordering
   - Implement middleware bypass options
   - Add middleware execution tracking for debugging

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache route compilation results
   - Implement lazy loading for large route trees
   - Add route validation at startup

This system provides a powerful and elegant solution for Express.js routing, but users should be aware of its opinions and potential infrastructure considerations, particularly regarding the trailing slash requirement.
